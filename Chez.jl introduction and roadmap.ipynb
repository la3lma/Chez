    "## Introduction\n",
    "This notebook is intended as a guide to my current toy project of making a\n",
    "reinforcement-learning based chess-playing program. It's inspired by alphazero, \n",
    "but it's more just a tool for me to learn a bit about reinforcement learning than anything else. In other words: Don't take it too seriously.\n",
    "    \n",
    "The program is built in multiple layers.   \n",
    "\n",
    "* The first layer is the basic game mechanics of chess: Move around on the board, find legal moves, print out board positions and moves etc. Chess is implemented, but there are some elements missing. In particular there is no rooking, no en passant, and no draws forced from repeated moves.   These can be added, but I felt that the subset of chess currently implemented is fine as a \"minimum viable chess\", for the purposes of this project. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The second layer is about gameplay.  How to play against an opponent, how to run tournaments and score the performance of the participants in the tournaments.   At this time the only tournaments are between two players, but they do play a number of matches \n",
    "\n",
    "* The third layer is about reinforcement learning.  In particular deep reinforcement learning.    It is by far the least mature of the three layers, but it is complete to the extent that it is possible to put run tournaments between players that are defined by artificual neural networks implemented using Flux.jl.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will  present each of these layers and how to access them as a developer.   The first thing to do is to include the \"chez.jl\" file.  This will load all the necessary libraries, and run some unit tests etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these unit tests involve playing a short turnament, so don't be alarmed if it says so.\n",

    "Actually, most of the work is probably future work.   The basic mechanics of \"tournament learning\" is probably in place now.  However, it's not done.   Also it would be nice to able to picle the players so that they can be used in different settings later. In particular it could be nice to play against it to see if it is any way behaving as a reasonable opponent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently the network learning takes most of the time (as it should). However, it could be speeded up significantly by using GPUs.  That should be easy, but since I haven't run this code on a GPU-enabled machine yet, that part hasn't been done.  It should be a ten line (or less) code patch.\n",
    "\n",
    "That however is not the most important part: The actual reinforcement learning algorithm, and the neural network that does the learning is really very bad.  It is little more than placeholders that has been implemented to build the mechanics necessary to start development of players in ernest. ... That's where we are now.  The way forward should be done something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Read throught the alphazero/alphago papers one more time.\n",
    "* Read through some of the software that has been published that are inspired by alphazero/alphago.\n",
    "* Modify the learning algorithm to be more in line with the techniques described in those papers.   \n",
    "* Have discussions with people about what a reasonable implementation can be, or even better, how to construct an experiment that will give answers about that question.\n",
    "* Abstract the chess out of the picture .-). By that I mean that there are a number of \"layering violations\" in the current software.   Knowledge about chess mechanics permeates all of the code.  However, it should be possible to make abstract games of which chess is only one instance.   That level of abstraction isn't done yet, but at some point in the not too distant future it should be done.\n",
    "* Make the julia code nicer.  Add more ideomatic features, make it clearer, more consistent (camel/snake-casing for isntance).\n",
    "* Make it accessible for others to tinker with.  Learning is the whole point of this project, and sharing that joy is a big part of the motivation behind doing this."
