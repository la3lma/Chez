    "## Introduction\n",
    "This notebook is intended as a guide to my current toy project of making a\n",
    "reinforcement-learning based chess-playing program. It's inspired by alphazero, \n",
    "but it's more just a tool for me to learn a bit about reinforcement learning than anything else. In other words: Don't take it too seriously.\n",
    "    \n",
    "The program is built in multiple layers.   \n",
    "\n",
    "* The first layer is the basic game mechanics of chess: Move around on the board, find legal moves, print out board positions and moves etc. Chess is implemented, but there are some elements missing. In particular there is no rooking, no en passant, and no draws forced from repeated moves.   These can be added, but I felt that the subset of chess currently implemented is fine as a \"minimum viable chess\", for the purposes of this project. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The second layer is about gameplay.  How to play against an opponent, how to run tournaments and score the performance of the participants in the tournaments.   At this time the only tournaments are between two players, but they do play a number of matches \n",
    "\n",
    "* The third layer is about reinforcement learning.  In particular deep reinforcement learning.    It is by far the least mature of the three layers, but it is complete to the extent that it is possible to put run tournaments between players that are defined by artificual neural networks implemented using Flux.jl.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will  present each of these layers and how to access them as a developer.   The first thing to do is to include the \"chez.jl\" file.  This will load all the necessary libraries, and run some unit tests etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these unit tests involve playing a short turnament, so don't be alarmed if it says so.\n",
    "\n",
