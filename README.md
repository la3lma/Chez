chezjulia
=========

A little finger exercise to get a feel for julia, may also contain
elements of a chess program ;-)

To run it, start julia, then run

      include("chez.jl")


This will load the code and run unit tests.





Look into this stuff:
==

o Look at Se p√•. Cukoo, nicely written java.
o Bitboards, magic number, pawn hashing
o Teknikker, zobrist, polyglot, sluttspill databaser 2gb
o Arena chess for lokal testing, ccrl for global ranking.
o Norwegiangambit.com
